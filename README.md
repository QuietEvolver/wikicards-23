```gherkin=
Feature: View results of an entered topic 

  # The first example has two steps
  Scenario: User enters in a topic of choice
    When upon visiting the home page, inputs a topic and clicks the 'Submit' button,
    Then app renders entered text with synopsis and image of topi

  # The second example has three steps
  Scenario: Breaker joins a game
    Given the Maker has started a game with the word "silky"
    When the Breaker joins the Maker's game

```gherkin=
Feature: Shopping Cart
  As a Shopper
  I want to put items in my shopping cart
  Because I want to manage items before I check out

  Scenario: User adds item to cart
    Given I'm a logged-in User
    When I go to the Item page
    And I click "Add item to cart"
    Then the quantity of items in my cart should go up
    And my subtotal should increment
    And the warehouse inventory should decrement
```
